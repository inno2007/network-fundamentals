# 🌐 Network Fundamentals

This repository contains detailed notes and summaries from my coursework on **Computer Networking Fundamentals**. Topics include OSI/TCP-IP models, routing, transport protocols, IP addressing, packet switching, and more.

All notes are written clearly for revision, interview prep, and technical demonstration.
